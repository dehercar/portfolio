Hi!

I’m writing to inform you that I need four days leave from 4th to 7th in June. The issue is that I joined TCS on March 5th and I still don’t have leave days balance so I want to request an unpaid leave, but I want to compensate the leave either 4 Saturdays after or in holidays to have them paid. So, this email is intended to express you this need and to hear from you how can we handle this.

I appreciate everyone’s willingness to help me on this.

Kind regards,

David.
