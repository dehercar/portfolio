## Relevant Projects

### **UNSPSC Categorizer** 
NLP tool developed in Python using RegEx, NLTK and scikit-learn (Tfidf, SVM) and Descriptions-UNSPSC labels as datasource (csv) to retrieve UNSPSC for a given part description.

[See repository.](https://github.com/dehercar/UNSPSC_Categorizer)


### **Part Number Matcher**
This Power BI dashboard uses as datasource conclusions about similarities on Part Numbers to identify duplicated developed with Python and using RegEx, fuzzywuzzy and PyODBC libraries to connect to SQL Server, as well as gathering data from other Power BI datasources using DAX Studio. Datasource length about 1 million rows.

### **Productivity Predictor**
â€¢	Created a medallion schema with Dimension and Fact tables.
â€¢	Ingested SAP price update requests and raw material prices (REST API) via Azure Data Factory pipelines to calculate productivity impacts using Databricks.
â€¢	Used KERAS to develop Neural Networks for predicting parts cost and estimate impact productivity.
â€¢	Used and Optimize Synapse SQL Pools allowing direct connections from Power BI and Tableau.

##### Volumes
- Gather data from Tableau Server with forecast volumes at part number level made by different areas.
- Creation of SQL Server Tables to store. 
- ETL with SSIS dataflows.
- Load data with PyODBC as described in Unit Costs predictions section.


##### Market Raw Material Indices
- Gather Market Raw Material Indices data from SQL Server to Python.
- Get cost breakdowns implementing financial calculations to Market Indices in Total Parts Cost manipulating and merging data with Pandas.


#### 2. Money Leakage
- Join Price Update Requests and issued Invoices data to find Productivity GAP comparing prices using efficient conditional Joins with relevant date fields among others.

The Tableau dashboard was made with features such as merge datasources, blend relationships, use of parameters, LOD expressions, etc.

### **Sea Level Predictor** 
The objective of this project is to predict sea levels for 2050 based on a dataset of global sea levels since 1880.

This project in Jupyter Notebook uses Pandas, Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib.

[See repository.](https://github.com/dehercar/sea_level_predictor) 


### **Cardiac Diseases**
These modules were developed to perform data analysis over a dataset of 70k patients. Variables like blood preasure, height, weigth, patologies, etc were examinated on them.

By analyzing demographic, medical and habits data we want to determine if they can lead into a cardiac disease.

[See repository.](https://github.com/dehercar/medical_data)


### Blacklist System
This project was made for a Debt Collection team. 

The objective of this project is to have a control of blocked phone numbers and emails for clients with problems in their credits.

It was implemented using Windows Forms automated with Excel Macros as GUI and connected to SQL Server database secured by Windows Authentication.

**Git and Github for version control in all projects.**

**General automations with Power Automate, dataloader.io, DemandTools and Web Scraper Platform.**
